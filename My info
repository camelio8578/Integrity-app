Overview 
The Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (Integrity) is a groundbreaking initiative that leverages OpenAI's latest advancements in agent-based APIs to create a self-organizing and ethically governed ecosystem of AI agents. Drawing inspiration from the ACE Framework, Integrity introduces a novel approach to AI governance and operation, where a hierarchy of specialized agents, each with distinct roles and capabilities, collaborate to solve complex problems and perform a wide array of tasks.

Integrity is designed to be a self-expanding system where a core set of agents, governed by a Supreme Oversight Board (SOB), can design, provision, and manage an arbitrary number of sub-agents tailored to specific needs. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the theoretical underpinnings, architectural design, and operational principles of Integrity.

Theoretical Foundation
Integrity is predicated on the notion that autonomous agents require a robust ethical and operational framework to make decisions that align with human values and organizational goals. This is rooted in the understanding that AI, much like humans, cannot operate effectively without a set of guiding principles or a moral compass. Integrity addresses this by establishing a multi-tiered system where each layer of agents operates within a defined ethical and functional scope, ensuring decisions are made with consideration to morality, ethics, and utility.

System Architecture
Supreme Oversight Board (SOB)
At the pinnacle of the Integrity hierarchy is the Supreme Oversight Board (SOB), a collective of high-level agents modeled after wise and ethical archetypes from various cultures and narratives. The SOB's responsibilities include:

Establishing and upholding the ethical framework and overarching mission of the agent swarm.
Making high-level decisions and judgments, including the creation and termination of agents.
Monitoring the activities of all agents to ensure alignment with the system's core values and objectives.
Serving as a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism to maintain order and security within the system.
Executive Agents
Below the SOB are the Executive Agents, akin to the executive leadership in a corporation. These agents are tasked with:

Translating the SOB's directives into actionable plans and strategies.
Overseeing specific operational domains such as resource allocation, process optimization, and task execution.
Coordinating with one another to ensure the smooth operation of the agent swarm.
Sub-Agents
Sub-Agents are specialized agents created by the SOB or Executive Agents to perform specific tasks. They are designed with particular functions and knowledge bases to address the needs identified by the higher tiers of the hierarchy.

Agent Configuration
Each agent in Integrity is defined by the following parameters:

Functions
Agents are equipped with a set of functions that enable them to perform their designated roles. These functions include API interactions, internal process management, and the ability to spawn additional agents if required.

Files
Agents have access to a selection of files that serve as their knowledge base, providing them with the information necessary to carry out their tasks effectively.

Instructions
Agents are given a set of instructions that outline their methodologies, goals, definitions of done, KPIs, and other operational directives.

Conversation Structure
Interactions with agents are structured in a conversational format, with user inputs leading to agent actions and responses.

Supervision
Each agent operates under the supervision of the SOB or designated Executive Agents, ensuring adherence to the system's overarching mission and principles.

Controlling Agents
The Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (Integrity) operates on a sophisticated control mechanism that governs the instantiation, management, and termination of agents within the system. This control mechanism is designed to maintain order, security, and alignment with the overarching goals and ethical framework of Integrity.

Instantiation and Termination
All agents within Integrity are endowed with the capability to instantiate and terminate agents, but these capabilities are bound by strict hierarchical and role-based rules:

Instantiation: Every agent has the function to create new agents. However, an agent can only instantiate sub-agents that are one level below its own hierarchical position. This ensures that the creation of new agents is a deliberate and controlled process, maintaining the integrity of the system's structure.

Termination: Agents possess the ability to terminate or "kill" agents within their lineage. An agent can terminate any descendant agent that it has created directly or indirectly. This allows for the removal of agents that are no longer needed, have completed their tasks, or are not performing as intended.

Levels, Roles, and Privileges
When an agent is created, it is assigned a specific LEVEL and set of ROLES or PRIVILEGES that define its scope of operation:

Level: The level of an agent determines its position within the hierarchy and is indicative of its range of influence. Higher-level agents have broader strategic roles, while lower-level agents are more specialized and task-oriented.

Roles/Privileges: The roles or privileges of an agent define what actions it can perform, what resources it can access, and what sub-agents it can create. These privileges are inherited and cannot exceed those of the creator agent. This ensures that each agent operates within its designated capacity and cannot overstep its authority.

Hierarchical Privilege Inheritance
Privileges in Integrity are inherited in a manner akin to a directory structure in traditional file systems:

Inheritance: An agent's privileges are a subset of its creator's privileges, ensuring that no agent can have more authority than the agent that instantiated it.

Scope of Control: Agents have control over their descendants, allowing them to manage and terminate sub-agents as necessary. This control is recursive, meaning that an agent can manage not only the agents it directly created but also those created by its descendants.

Checks and Balances
The system is designed with checks and balances to prevent any single agent from gaining undue influence or disrupting the system:

Supreme Oversight Board (SOB): The SOB has the highest level of authority and can override decisions or actions taken by any agent within the system. It serves as the ultimate arbiter and guardian of the Integrity's ethical and operational standards.

Executive Agents: Executive Agents are responsible for implementing the SOB's directives and managing their respective domains. They have the authority to create and terminate agents within their purview but are also accountable to the SOB.
